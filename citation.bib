  abstract =	 "The Princeton WordNet for the English language has
                  been used worldwide in NLP projects for many
                  years. With the OMW initiative, wordnets for
                  different languages of the world are being linked
                  via identifiers. The parallel development and
                  linking allows new multilingual application
                  perspectives. The development of a wordnet for the
                  German language is also in this context. To save
                  development time, existing resources were combined
                  and recompiled. The result was then evaluated and
                  improved. In a relatively short time a resource was
                  created that can be used in projects and
                  continuously improved and extended."
